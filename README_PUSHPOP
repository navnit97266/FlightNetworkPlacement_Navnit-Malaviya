Push/Pop functionality of stack and pattern matching.

?	Programming Language used: C
?	Program uses three function for implementing push , pop and for checking stack is empty or not.
?	 At first I prompt user for whether he wants to push element or entering sequence or exit. 
	For that I take input from user like choice 1 or 2 or 3.
	If user enters choice other than from display it will give message Enter valid choice.
?	After selecting 1st choice first program check stack is empty or not. 
	If stack is empty element is pushed. And if stack is not empty than program compare previously pushed element with current element. 
	If current element is +1 more than previous element than only current element is valid. 
	Otherwise program show message u cant pushed current element as per given rules.
?	After selecting 2nd choice user is prompt for enter sequence of number.
	After entering sequence first program find minimum no. from descending sequence. 
	After that from minimum no. to the first element of descending sequence program push all elements in to the stack. 
	And pop the one element and print it. And also pop another element and assign it to temp variable. 
	This temp variable is used for the pattern matching purpose.
?	After all this pattern matching loop if the temp contain -1 (stack is empty) pattern is valid. 
	Otherwise it is invalid pattern. Pattern is invalid than program show message enter valid pattern.
?	 3rd option for the exit the program.
